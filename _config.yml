  I'm pursuing a Geology and Computer Science double major at California State University, Fullerton, where I'm working on an undergraduate thesis alongside an assistant professor of Geology and a professor of Computer Science. Our research is focused on developing a Python-based application to streamline the workflow and time management of geochronologists working with detrital zircon datasets.

  In Summer 2023, I'll be working as a field assistant on academic research in the India-Asia suture zone in Tibet, China for six weeks. Additionally, I currently serve as a student community service officer, patrolling designated areas and securing the campus.

  I plan to use my diverse background and experience to pursue a career as a federal geologist in the geoinformatics field. My goal is to help create and manage geological information networks to address issues related to GIS, geospatial, and other geotechnical challenges.

          An application has been developed to address challenges in organizing and managing diverse detrital zircon datasets. It automatically assumes data formatting and stores it in a personalized SQL database, with a step-by-step wizard for user confirmation. Custom tags, integration with online databases, and export options enhance usability. The application supports filtering, plotting, splitting, merging, and sharing of the SQL database. It emphasizes open-source version control for user feedback and contributions. While AI tools like Chat GPT are intriguing, this application aims to optimize research methods for geochronologists and seamlessly integrate with existing tools. It streamlines data management, aids analysis, and ensures compatibility. After closed alpha development, it will benefit geochronologists and facilitate integration with established tools.

          As a Field Assistant in Tibet, I conducted extensive field research and collected data to support academic studies on environmental and geological phenomena. This included exploring remote locations, analyzing samples, and contributing to the understanding of the unique geological features and environmental conditions in the region. I worked under my undergraduate thesis advisor, [Kate Metcalf](https://www.fullerton.edu/geology/people/faculty/kmetcalf.php), along with three collegues from University of Alabama and one graduate student from the [Institute of Tibetan Plateau Research Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://english.itpcas.cas.cn)
